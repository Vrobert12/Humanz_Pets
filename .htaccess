# This rule doesn’t change the URL but sets an environment variable for handling HTTP authorization headers.
# Pattern: .*
# The .* pattern matches any URL.
# Rewrite Target: -
# The - symbol means "no substitution" — the URL won’t be rewritten.

# Flag: [e=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
# This sets an environment variable HTTP_AUTHORIZATION with the value of the Authorization header from the HTTP request
# (%{HTTP:Authorization}).

# This rule is often used to pass authorization headers to PHP scripts, especially if they aren’t being passed
# automatically by the server configuration. It’s commonly used when handling authentication tokens in APIs.
